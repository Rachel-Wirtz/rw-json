JSON in 2023, not only because of the growing number of web based applications, is one of the most common text based serialization formats used. Languages such as Python, C# (.NET), obviously Javascript and many others support it natively.

## How does it work?

rw-json is a single header file library. Even tho it is currently not longer than 1600 lines, the code is a bit messy to read by nature.
Therefor a quick start guide you find [here](https://github.com/Rachel-Wirtz/rw-json/wiki/Quick-Start) and a documentation explaining the entire public API for the current version is available as well [here](https://github.com/Rachel-Wirtz/rw-json/wiki/rw::json).

**Happy coding!**
